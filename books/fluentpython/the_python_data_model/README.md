## Deck of Cards

```

## Vector Object 
```shell

```

# Chapter Review
In the chapter The Python Data Model two classes were introduced to display the power of python special methods. 
The deck of cards and the vector class implemented a few dunder methods to allow them to behave like built-in
python data types. This allows developers to be able to expect how an object may behave for use in their code.
Basic requirements is to provide a usable string representation which is acomplished through a __repr__ method.
As seen in the french deck, emulating a sequence widely used. There is a wide variety of special methods
as seen on page 13 of Fluent Python.
