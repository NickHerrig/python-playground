# An Array of Sequences

# Overview of Sequences 
## Container Sequences
list, tuple, collections.deque

## Flat Sequences
str, bytes, bytearray, memoryview, array.array

## mutable sequences
list, bytearray, array.array, collections.deque, memoryview

## immutable sequences
str, tuple, bytes

## List comps and Genexps
Master these! 

## Tuples
immutable lists or records with unnamed fields(unless of course you use an namedtuple!

## Augmented assigment (ie +=)
behaves differently for muytable and immutable sequences. change in place vs new object.

## Behond lists
Many useful and purpose built types available per use case! 
- array.array
- collections.deque
